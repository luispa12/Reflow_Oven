# Open Source Reflow Oven


## Introduction
The reflow Oven is a custom made PCB, based on the design from RocketScream (tiny reflow oven), it is based on the atmega328p, featuring a MAX31865 to control the thermocuple, an Oled LCD to see the reflow process on real time.

## Project Description
Detailed description of the hardware project, including its purpose, objectives, and unique features.

This project was done with the idea of having my own reflow oven at home, so I can do the manufacturing process at my lab, it consist on only 3 main components, the PCB, an SSR and, of course, a oven.



## Design Process
Insights into the design process, challenges faced, and key design decisions made.

For this project, I wanted the PCB to be the smallest I can, but taking into consideration that I don't have proper tools to assemble it at home (the reason why I'm doing this reflow oven), so I decided to use 0806 components, which can be relativily easy to solder by hand and a heat gun.
The most difficult component to solder was the Atmega328 because I only got the QFN package, which is very small, but after a lot of attempts I was able to solder it succesfully.

I also needed the pcb to be small enough to fit inside the oven without doing so much modification, and have a small overall footprint.

Documentation is still on progress...
